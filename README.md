## Techniques Used

- **Event Bubbling and Event Delegation**: Leveraged to handle events efficiently, especially for dynamically generated elements.
- **Responsive Design with CSS Media Queries**: Modified for responsiveness to ensure optimal viewing and interaction across devices of different screen sizes.
- **Custom CSS Animations and Transitions**: Personalized animations and transitions added to enhance the user experience and create a pleasant interface.
